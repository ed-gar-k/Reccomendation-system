# Business Understanding
In today's competitive streaming industry, user engagement and satisfaction are paramount. Personalized recommendation systems play a crucial role in meeting these demands by guiding users through a vast array of movie choices and suggesting content aligned with their preferences. The GiggleStream Movie Recommendation System aims to set new standards of excellence by providing tailored movie recommendations that delight users and keep them coming back for more.

# Problem Statement
The primary goal of this project is to recommend the top 5 movies to Money-Team Co$ users based on customer ratings of other movies. By leveraging collaborative filtering techniques and advanced algorithms, we seek to enhance user satisfaction, engagement, and retention on the GiggleStream platform.

# Data Understanding
The project utilizes the MovieLens dataset, a rich and diverse collection of movie ratings, links, genres, and tags. This dataset serves as the backbone for our recommendation system, providing valuable insights into user preferences and movie characteristics. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we gain a deeper understanding of the dataset's structure, distribution, and missing values, laying the foundation for building robust recommendation models.

# Recommendation Models
The repository contains implementations of various recommendation models, including:

User-Item Collaborative Filtering using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Item-Item Collaborative Filtering with cosine similarity
User-User Collaborative Filtering using Pearson correlation
These models leverage different algorithms and similarity metrics to generate personalized movie recommendations for users, enhancing their movie-watching experience on GiggleStream.
